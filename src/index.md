#### Our mission

To give people the convenience to install
apps without using storage space and to 
have an alternative app store that is not
a monopoly and is easier to use.

#### Our motivation

We are tired of the monopoly of other 
app marketplaces and of the storage
hungry apps and often interrupting
updates. That's why we made Paquet.

#### Our team

Our team is composed of **Sultan**, **Stefanos**, **Gabriela**, **Lara**,  and **Mario**

There is no boss, we all have equal shares and power in the company.
This way we can ensure that we have a lot of brain power and decisions
cannot be made without consent and aproval.
